# SimFarm
Farm simulation game was built in Microsoft Visual C# within a team of 4 people. 

SimFarm simluation allows players to be charge of building up the land, buying and selling livestock and planting crops. 

A weather and season system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm. As with SimCity, there are disasters that can wreak havoc on the player's farm. Tornadoes, droughts, pests, and dust storms are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and harvests.
